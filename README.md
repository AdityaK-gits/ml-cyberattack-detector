# ml-cyberattack-detector
A hybrid cybersecurity attack detection system that combines rule-based filtering with a machine learning (Random Forest) model to accurately detect network intrusions. Built using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, this project demonstrates layered threat detection, feature importance analysis, and real-time classification strategies.
